# DNA-Image_Classification_X-Ray_scans_CNN
Classification of X-Ray scans using Convolutional neural network from scratch and with VGGNet architecture
1.) Created the neural net architecture from scratch and trained the model
2.) Used one of the pretrained neural network architecture (VGG16) which is trained on Imagenet data.
